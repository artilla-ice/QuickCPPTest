# Quick Technical Test

Instructions:
Based on the provided information, describe the operation of the following 3 items. Must include at least one example of each of the following.

o	Low-level storage access / SPDK
o	Use of bitwise operations (^, &, >>, <<, |, ~)
o	gRPC, mTLS  

Answers:

1. Low-level storage access / SPDK:
   - Operation: SPDK (Storage Performance Development Kit) is a framework for building high-performance, user-space storage applications. It provides low-level access to storage devices, bypassing the traditional kernel I/O path for improved efficiency.
   - Example: In SPDK, you can create a simple storage application that directly reads and writes data to an NVMe SSD without involving the OS kernel. This improves storage performance significantly.

2. Use of bitwise operations (^, &, >>, <<, |, ~):
   - Operation: Bitwise operations are used to manipulate individual bits in binary representations of data.
   - Example: Suppose you want to check if a number is even or odd using bitwise operators in C++:
     bool isEven(int num) {
         return (num & 1) == 0; // The bitwise AND operation with 1 checks the least significant bit.
     }


3. gRPC, mTLS:
   - Operation: gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework, and mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol for encrypted communication between services.
   - Example: You can use gRPC with mTLS to secure communication between microservices. For instance, you can configure a C++ gRPC server and client to establish a secure connection with mutual authentication and data encryption.

For code documentation in C++:

- Utilize Doxygen or similar tools to generate documentation from code comments.
- Add comments above classes, functions, and variables to describe their purpose and usage.
- Use inline comments for complex or non-obvious code sections to explain the logic.
- Document function parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- Include examples in the comments to illustrate how to use functions or classes.
